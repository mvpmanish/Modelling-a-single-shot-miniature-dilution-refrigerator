# Modelling-a-single-shot-miniature-dilution-refrigerator
A mathematical model to output the physical variables (pressure, temperature etc.) inside a single-shot miniauture dilution refrigerator as it undergoes dilution.
Two computational models describing the performance of the SSMDR have been constructed: a steady-state model and a dynamical model (where the cool down is modelled over time).
